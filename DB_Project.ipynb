    "#### WHAT IS CREDIT RISK AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n",
    "When giving a loan a creditor,also known as lender provides goods and services to a debtor who can be referred to as borrowers based on the trust that borrower will repay the lender. when someone fails to repay a loan,it is said to be default.The possiblity that someone who has borrowed money will default is known as Credit Risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lenders inability or failure to  estimate borrowers probablity of default can have grave consequences for lenders and society.In general lending to borrowers with a high probability of default is one of the main reasons for serious financial crisis such as the global financial crisis in 2008.It was the most serious financial crisis since the times of the Great Depression in the 1930s.The main factor that led to the 2008 financial crisis was high default rates of subprime home mortgages. Many big banks like Lehmam Brothers and Bear Stearns went bakrupt.Therefore that's one example why credit risk is one of the most important variables in the financialsystem of today.\n",
    "#### Project Focus\n",
    "It is important is to be able to estimate credit risk of each borrower as precisely as possible.Hence, or project focuses on creating three different models a PD or probability of default model showing the probability of a customer not repaying their debt and LGD or loss givendefault model showing the proportion of an exposure a company loses when a customer defaults and an\n",
    "EAD or exposure at default model showing the total loss in terms of amount of money the bank is exposed to if a customer defaults.Using this information we'll create a score card.The score cards are identical to the ones bank officers use on a daily basis to accept or reject loan applications.Finally we'll combine these three models to calculate the total expected loss for the whole portfolio of loans that the bank holds the expected loss or E.L."
